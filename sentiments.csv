If you look at the major rebrands of 2021-from Burger King to GM-almost all of them involve paring down, flattening, or simplifying a brand's look. The driving factor is more than just a trend in our visual language-it's about adjusting to our new normal as companies and consumers. As we're all too aware, the world is changing at an unprecedented pace. Brands are looking for simple designs that give them flexibility to adapt across new platforms, appeal to new audiences, and pivot as things change around them. And-jokes about Chrome's new logo aside-consumers are craving simplicity in an increasingly complex world. A 2021 study by brand strategy agency Siegel+Gale found that 76% of people are more likely to recommend a brand that delivers simple experiences. While this shift is important for all companies to pay attention to, it presents an especially exciting opportunity for startups, which are constantly changing by nature. When done correctly, approaching branding with simplicity can help startups more easily align their brand with their strategy-and save a lot of money in the process.","https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2022/04/p-1-90740082-the-biggest-design-trend-of-2022-keep-it-simple.jpg",Fast Company,n/a,www.fastcompany.com,-0.521357,Bearish,0.047027,-0.776511,Bearish,Energy & Transportation|Technology,0.5|0.5
